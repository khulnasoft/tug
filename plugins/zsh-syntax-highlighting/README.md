**zsh-syntax-highlighing** adds [fish](https://fishshell.com/)-like syntax highlighting for zsh


The plugin highlights commands while they are being typed into a zsh prompt in an interactive terminal.   This helps in reviewing commands before running them, particularly in catching syntax errors.



### Notes

zsh-syntax-highlighting should be the last plugin sourced in your list of plugins otherwise it may not work.
