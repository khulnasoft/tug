# ðŸŒˆ Z Colors
Use your Gnu `$LS_COLORS` or BSD `$LSCOLORS` to generate a coherent theme for `git`, `less`,
`grep`, and your Zsh prompt, completions and command line.  Don't know how to or don't feel like
customizing your colors?  No worries: Z Colors comes with an excellent default theme, too.

## Usage
Once you've installed Z Colors with the steps [below](#installation), then your theme is
automatically applied to `git`, `less`, `grep` plus Zsh completions and
[command line](#requirements).  No other steps are required for these.

For adding colors to your prompt, Z Colors provides an associative array `$zcolor` containing the
theme values for file types `di`, `ln`, `so`, `pi`, `ex`, `bd`, `cd`, `su`, `sg`, `tw` and `ow`.
You can use it like this:
```zsh
# $'...': string with support for `print` escape codes
# %{<esc>%}: Tell the prompt that <esc> is zero-width output.
# %{\e[0m%}: Reset all colors and other highlighting.
# %~: present working dir;  %#: `%` for normal user, `#` for root
PS1=$'%{\e['$zcolor[di]$'m%}%~%{\e[m%}/ %# '
```

## Requirements
If you use `$LS_COLORS`, then the values for `di`, `ln`, `so`, `pi`, `ex`, `bd`, `cd`, `su`, `sg`,
`tw` and `ow` need to contain 3- or 4-bit colors only.  8- and 24-bit colors are currently _not_
supported!

For your theme be used to highlight your command line, you will need to also install
[`zsh-syntax-highlighting`](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting).
