Alf - Out of this World Zsh
===========================

Alf is an out of this world super fast and configurable framework for [zsh][4]; it's modeled after [Prezto][1] and [Antigen][2]. The framework is currently utilizing [Oh My Zsh][3] (framework, plugins and themes) and optionally [Prezto's][1] plugins under the covers; and offers standard defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, automated updates and installable prompt themes and plugins.

Why another framework?
----------------------

At my work I needed to support a similar shell environment across OS X, Windows, and Parallels (running a virtual machine with an OS X host). Originally I was able to get Cygwin running with [Oh My Zsh][3], but I wasn't really happy with the performance. So I started scripting and hacking around and learning Bash and [Zsh][4].

Customization
-------------

The project is managed via [Git][6]. It is highly recommended that you fork this project; so, that you can commit your changes and push them to [GitHub][7] to not lose them. If you do not know how to use Git, follow this [tutorial][8] and bookmark this [reference][9].

Resources
---------

The [Zsh Reference Card][10] and the [zsh-lovers][11] man page are indispensable.  [awesome-zsh-plugins](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins) is a list of zsh plugins and themes that you may also find useful.
