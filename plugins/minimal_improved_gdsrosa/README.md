# Minimal Improved

Minimal _Improved_. Super clean and minimal theme for Oh My ZSH. :sparkles:

## Getting Started

Clone this repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gdsrosa/minimal_improved.git  
$ cd minimal_improved
```

### Installing

Once you're inside the `minimal_improved` directory, move the `minimal_improved.zsh-theme` file to your oh-my-zsh directory (usually `~/.oh-my-zsh`):

```
$ mv minimal_improved.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/
```

Then go to your `~/.zshrc` file and change `ZSH_THEME` to `minimal_improved` using your favorite editor:

```
$ vim ~/.zshrc
ZSH_THEME="minimal_improved"
```

For your changes to take immediate effect run `$ source ~/.zshrc` and your terminal will look like this:
