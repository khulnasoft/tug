## Usage
```
copyzshell <remote machine>
```

The remote machine adress has the same format as the normal ssh command.
It will prompt you for your password up to 3 times (one to scp the files, one 
to ssh into the machine, and one to change your login shell to zsh).

The next time you log in to the remote machine you should get your own cozy, 
customised shell!
