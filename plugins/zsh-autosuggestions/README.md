_[Fish](http://fishshell.com/)-like fast/unobtrusive autosuggestions for zsh._

It suggests commands as you type based on history and completions.

Requirements: Zsh v4.3.11 or later

## Usage

As you type commands, you will see a completion offered after the cursor
in a muted gray color. This color can be changed by setting the `Highlight
Style` configuration option.

If you press the <kbd>â†’</kbd> key (`forward-char` widget) or <kbd>End</kbd> (`end-of-line` widget) with the cursor at the end of the buffer, it will accept the suggestion, replacing the contents of the command line buffer with the suggestion.

If you invoke the `forward-word` widget, it will partially accept the suggestion up to the point that the cursor moves to.

### Key Bindings

This plugin provides a few widgets that you can use with `bindkey`:

1. `autosuggest-accept`: Accepts the current suggestion.
2. `autosuggest-execute`: Accepts and executes the current suggestion.
3. `autosuggest-clear`: Clears the current suggestion.
4. `autosuggest-fetch`: Fetches a suggestion (works even when suggestions are disabled).
5. `autosuggest-disable`: Disables suggestions.
6. `autosuggest-enable`: Re-enables suggestions.
7. `autosuggest-toggle`: Toggles between enabled/disabled suggestions.

For example, this would bind <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>space</kbd> to accept the current suggestion.

```sh
bindkey '^ ' autosuggest-accept
```
