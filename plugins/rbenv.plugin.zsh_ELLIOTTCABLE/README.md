A Zsh plugin to auto-load [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and its completions into the shell.

Based on the rbenv plugin from [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), minus some slow operations (originally excluded by [nodenv.plugin.zsh](https://github.com/jsahlen/nodenv.plugin.zsh).)
