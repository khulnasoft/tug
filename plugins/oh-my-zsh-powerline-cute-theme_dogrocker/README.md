# oh-my-zsh-powerline-cute-theme

A oh-my-zsh shell theme based on the Powerline Vim plugin

This theme is base on [Bullet Train for oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/caiogondim/bullet-train-oh-my-zsh-theme). I modified some of the script.

## Preview

![Preview](http://raw.github.com/dogrocker/oh-my-zsh-powerline-cute-theme/master/img/demo-1.png)

## Color schemes

* I use [Monokai Soda](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/master/schemes/Monokai%20Soda.itermcolors) and I was changed some color you can do that to **iTerm 2 > Preferences > Profiles > Color**.
* You can download and modified your own schemes at [https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes).

## Requirements

In order to use the theme, you will first need:

* Powerline compatible fonts like [Vim Powerline patched fonts](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts) or [Input Mono](http://input.fontbureau.com/)
* [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
* Make sure terminal is using 256-colors mode with `export TERM="xterm-256color"`
* For [iTerm 2](http://iterm2.com/) users, make sure you go into your settings and set both the regular font and the non-ascii font to powerline compatible [fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) or the prompt separators and special characters will not display correctly.
