# gpg_agent.zsh

This is a **very** simple ZSH plugin that tries to do the right thing when it
comes to setting up the GPG agent to act as an SSH agent as well. Other options
out there did not work on OS X with gnupg2, which is what I needed.

# TODO

* act as an ssh agent only if the right option is set in gpg-agent.conf
