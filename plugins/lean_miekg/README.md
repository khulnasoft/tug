Lean is an evolution of pure prompt, with the following changes:

* Defaults to a very sparse setup, only showing information you need at the moment.
* Comes with the perfect prompt character. Author went through the entire ASCII range to find it (and found it pretty quickly!)
* Never displays your username.
* Show remote host if logged in through SSH.
* All in one line, most stuff in the right prompt, leaving the left prompt nice and clean
* Shows background jobs (in the left prompt)
* Offers many custom configuration options.
