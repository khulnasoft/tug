### Kinda-fishy theme

A ZSH theme based on oh-my-zsh [fishy theme](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes#fishy)
It differs in two aspects:
 1. The full path is shown instead of abbreviated directory names.
 2. ```$USER@$HOST``` is not shown for the local machine, only for SSH sessions and
 inside docker containers (in that case it is ```$USER@docker```)
