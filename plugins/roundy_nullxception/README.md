#       you can add space at the end of your defined symbol.
ROUNDY_EXITSTATUS_GOOD="ï«Ÿ"
# You can also using hex code like this
ROUNDY_EXITSTATUS_BAD=$'\uf658 '

# Minimal time (in ms) for the Time Execution of Command is displayed in prompt
# Set to 0 to disable it

ROUNDY_DIR_MODE="dir-only"

# Whether drawing a gap between a prompt

## ðŸŽ¨ Colors
By nature of Zsh, colors can be specified using :
- a decimal integer (0-15, or 0-255 if `$TERM` supported)
- alias of the eight colors provided by zsh
- or, as a regular #FFFFFF color hex (if `$TERM` supported, or with the help of `zsh/nearcolor` module)

```sh
# Command Exit Status
ROUNDY_COLORS_BG_EXITSTATUS=4
ROUNDY_COLORS_FG_EXITSTATUS=0

# Time Execution of Command
ROUNDY_COLORS_BG_TEXC=0
ROUNDY_COLORS_FG_TEXC=2

# User Display
ROUNDY_COLORS_BG_USER=8
ROUNDY_COLORS_FG_USER=7

# Directory Info
